### Hey! I'm Max Haberer, and I'm a high school student in Texas! <br/>

- 🛩🎮 I'm currently working on code for the 2024 Bell Advanced Vertical Robotics competition <br/>
- 🖥 I'm currently learning C++ and working with PX4, MavLink, and QGroundControl as part of Bell AVR <br/>
- 💬 I'm very interested in the automation of repetitive tasks and high user-friendliness <br/>
- 👨‍💻 I have an unhealthy obsession with saving nanoseconds by optimizing tiny things 🤷‍♂️<br/>
